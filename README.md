# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a basic app that uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for the Week 16 Assignment in Promineo Tech's "Front End Software Developer Course." 

At this point, your project must meet this new requirement:

    It has either a create form or an update form with at least 2 inputs

As well as the requirements from previous weeks:

    It has at least 3 React components

    It’s displaying the data

    It’s using at least 1 prop

    A user can create new items

    A user can delete items

    A user can update at least one property on the items

The app does NOT need to connect to an API. So when the page is refreshed, all the changes will be lost.
